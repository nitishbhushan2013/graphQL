React is used to build UI framework that will interact with GraphQLServer. Since both, react and GraphQL are not compatible, we need a GraphQL Client to help us to bind these two together to create a end-end flow. 
Apollo is used as GraphQL client to help us bind these two application to enable UI layer to make query to the GraphQL server and process the response.
