GraphQL Landscape
![GraphQL overview](https://github.com/nitishbhushan2013/graphQL/blob/master/images/graphQL-architecture.png)

GraphiQL is a graphical interactive in-browser GraphQL IDE. It enables us to interactively construct full queries for GraphQL Server.

React is used to build UI framework that will interact with GraphQLServer. Since both, react and GraphQL are not compatible, we need a GraphQL Client to help us to bind these two together to create a end-end flow. 
Apollo is used as GraphQL client to help us bind these two application to enable UI layer to make query to the GraphQL server and process the response.
